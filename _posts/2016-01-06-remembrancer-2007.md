> _Remembrancer_ consists of three subsystems: the _Lector_, the _Scrivener_, and the _Cantor_, and a medium onto which it will record its remembrances: the _Palimpsest_.
> 
> The Lector consists of a series of input devices including software and various sensors. It will observe events within three nested domains of published news: _local_, _national_ and _global_. These events will be passed on to the other two subsystems:
> 
> The Scrivener has three arms, one each to a domain, and will deposit media on a Palimpsest in quantities proportional to the magnitude of the events it is interpreting; The Cantor has three voices, one each to a domain, and will sing a transform of the events it is interpreting.
